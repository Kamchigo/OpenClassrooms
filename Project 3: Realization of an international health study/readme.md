# Project 3 : Realization of an international health study
 
This project is the third of the OpenClassrooms Data Analyst training. 
 
## Skills assessed

- Use specialized libraries for data processing
- Create a development environment
- Handling DataFrames

## Softwares / Programming languages

## Scenario

You recently joined a team of researchers at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as a data analyst.

Its role? It is one of the bodies that make up the United Nations and whose objective is "to help build a world free of hunger". 

The team leader, Marc, a health economics researcher, is particularly excited about your arrival in his team. Indeed, this recruitment comes at the right time because Julien, the former data analyst, has recently been transferred to another team, and yours has just been entrusted with the mission of carrying out a large-scale study on the theme of under-nutrition in the world.
