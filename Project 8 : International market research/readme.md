# Project 8 : International market research
This project is the 8th of the OpenClassrooms Data Analyst training. 
 
## Skills assessed

- Perform simple clustering
- Explore data to synthesize variables

## Softwares / Programming languages

- Python and its libraries : pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikitlearn


## Scenario

You work at "La poule qui chante", a French food company. It wants to expand internationally.
International, yes, but for the moment, the field of possibilities is quite large: no particular country or continent has been chosen for the moment. All countries are possible!

Your manager, Patrick, briefs you by e-mail:
Your objective will be to propose a first analysis of the country groupings that we can target to export our chickens. We will then deepen the market study. 
You will be totally autonomous on this project, especially on the choice of the data to analyze and even the language to use (R or Python).

## Deliverables

- Notebook containing the preparation, the cleaning and the exploratory analysis of the data.
- Notebook containing the clustering(s) performed, and the various associated visualizations.
- Presentation of the work done (Powerpoint).

## Version

- v1.0 : Initial release
